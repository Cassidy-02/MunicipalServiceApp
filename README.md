# MunicipalServiceApp
##Project Overview
This project is a C# Windows forms Application designed to improve resident engagement with municipal services.
Users can:
Report municipal issues (roads, water, electricity, etc.).
View previously reported issues.
Delete issues if needed.
Track engagement with feedback messages, labels, and counters.
The Main Menu (Form1) acts as the hub:
It never closes (only hides) when other forms are open.
When a sub-form is closed, Form1 reappears automatically.
